# IÂ´m going to use Visual Studio Code
# print is a function we can use to show things in the console.
# To execute a funtion we need to use ().
# For print if we need to show a string (text), we must use "", example:
print("Hello, I am Gustavo ")
# To save the data we are going to use cmd+s for macOs, ctrl+s for wndws.
# Tip if you see in the tittle (introduction.py) a circle instead of an X in VSC, is bcz you need to save.
# Tip open/close terminal with ctrl + ` or ctrl + < VSC
# To run the code we can use and extension and press the play button or we can write in the terminal python3 + files name (python3 introduction.py)
# I recommend the next extensions on VSC: Python, Pylint, autopep8.

# Function input is going to help us to input data from the users example:
name = input("Whats is your name?:  ")
