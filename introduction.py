# I´m going to use Visual Studio Code 
# print is a function we can use to show things in the console. 
# To execute a funtion we need to use ().
# For print if we need to show a string (text), we must use "", example:
print("Hello, I´m Gustavo ")
# To save the data we are going to use cmd+s fow macOs, ctrl+s for wndws.
# Tip if you see in the tittle (introduction.py) a circle instead of an X in VSC, is bcz you need to save.
# Tip open terminal with ctrl+` or ctrl+< VSC
